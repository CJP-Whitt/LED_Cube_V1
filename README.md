# LED Cube V1
Arduino LED Cube

This is code and descriptions of the process I have gone through to create an LED Cube. The LED is very useful for
understanding basic CS concepts and I beleive could be very useful in computer science education for youger audiences.
Also the LED Cube is just cool. With a good comprehension of hardware and coding you can do alot of things with 54
individually adressable LEDs.

Due to lack of documentation on my parts I dont have any pictures of the build process but you should be able to tell from the final product that it was not easy.

Here is a pic of the final product

And here is the insides...ya its not pretty, and thus why this is Version 1
![alt test](LEDCube_V1_Photos/Final_TopView.jpg)

- The LED Cube consists of a 3D printed shell with 2 halfs
- Inside that shell is strips of LEDs stranded together and glued down, you can see in this pic how they were layed down

- There is a tray that holds a Pro Trinket board with code running all of the light functions and controls for the MPU
- There is also a battery pack with a piggy back on the Trinket board for charging
- The ouside of the cube has a hole for charging and accessing the Trinket board, as well as a switch for on/off
